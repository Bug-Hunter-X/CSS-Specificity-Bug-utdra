The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected results. For example, consider the following scenario:

```html
<div id="myDiv">
  <p class="myParagraph">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

```css
#myDiv p {
  color: blue;
}

.myParagraph {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, both the `#myDiv p` and `.myParagraph` selectors target the paragraph element. However, the `#myDiv p` selector is more specific, as it includes an ID selector, so it will override the `.myParagraph` selector and the text will be blue, not red.
